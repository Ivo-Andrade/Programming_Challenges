# List of URI/UVA Judge exercises

Sample of programming challenges and exercises done, initially, for the Programming Challenges I & II courses at EACH-USP (School of Arts, Science and Humanities - University of SÃ£o Paulo). Eventually, this became a repository for code done for similar instances, should it be URI Judge, UVA Judge or other sources' exercises.
